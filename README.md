### Store Annual Report - Vrinda Store (2022)

This project analyzes Vrinda Store’s 2022 sales data to uncover customer behavior patterns and identify strategies for revenue growth in 2023. The data, provided by Arvind Store, was cleaned, processed, and analyzed using Excel, leading to the creation of an interactive, dynamic report with powerful insights into sales trends, demographics, and top-performing products and regions.

#### Project Overview
The primary objective was to help Vrinda Store understand its customer base, purchase patterns, and the key factors driving sales. Key questions addressed include:
- How do monthly sales and orders compare, and which month performed the best?
- What is the gender distribution among customers, and who purchases more—men or women?
- What are the various order statuses, and how did they trend over the year?
- Which states contribute the most to sales, and what are the top 10 states?
- How does age relate to gender in terms of purchase frequency?
- Which sales channels (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc.) generated the highest revenue?
- Which product categories sold the most?

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Data cleaning was critical to handling missing values, inconsistencies, and standardizing formats. Steps included:
- **Removing Duplicates**: Ensuring unique entries for more accurate analysis.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Filling gaps where feasible or removing irrelevant data points.
- **Standardizing Fields**: Aligning categorical values, such as gender, age group, and region, for consistency.

#### Data Analysis and Visualization
Utilizing Excel’s data visualization tools, the project explored and analyzed trends across various segments:
- **Sales and Orders Comparison**: A unified chart highlights monthly sales and orders, revealing peak periods.
- **Demographic Breakdown**: Pivot tables and charts show the distribution by gender, age group, and top purchasing states.
- **Order Status and Trends**: An analysis of order completion, cancellation, and return rates across months.
- **Geographic Insights**: Top 10 contributing states were identified, showing regional purchasing power and customer density.
- **Customer Profile**: A deep dive into age-gender relations uncovered age brackets most likely to purchase.
- **Sales Channel Analysis**: Determined which online platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra) were the top-performing channels.

#### Key Insights
The project yielded critical insights, including:
- **Women Customers**: Women are significantly more active buyers than men, contributing roughly 65% of total sales.
- **Top Regions**: Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are leading contributors, making up around 35% of total sales.
